# DPLModel

**DPLModel** is a Python-based deep learning project designed for building height prediction using satellite images (Sentinel-2 data). The project utilizes a U-Net architecture for image segmentation and regression to predict building heights and footprints from satellite images. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.

## Features
- Building height prediction from Sentinel-2 images
- U-Net based architecture for segmentation and regression tasks
- Preprocessing of satellite images with normalization and resampling
- Data augmentation and transformation support
- Performance evaluation with metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score
